### Using iPSC-derived cortical organoids for modeling early aspects of human cortical development and disorders

* stem cells -> organoids (?)
* we don't understand what happens on molecular level in brain
* animal model observations -> humans
* differences between human and mouse brain

Alzheimer's:

- 1991 amyloid hypothesis
- 1995 - mouse model
- complex genetics
- clinical trials fail

Huntington's:

- mutation discovered

Fragile X synd.
- 1994 mouse model
- mGluR hypothesis
clinical trials fail

Our approach:
- collect material from patients: skin cells
- induced pluripotent SC (using Yamanak factors)
- differentiate into cortical neurons


Pheland-McDermid synd.

(autism, epylepsy)

-> we found that existing drug (IGFI) can be used to treat

brain consists of few dozens of embrionic stem cells

protocols for making human "mini-brains"

generating cortical organoids from single stem cell-derived neural rosette

### Mapping scRNA-seq data to cell type taxonomies using cell atlases

http://www.nxn.se

cs transcriptomic data
Generalised linear models
matrix of cells-rna expression levels

the more cells you sequence, the more cell types you see
taxonomic cell types

using logistic regression for nested classes
allows comparing similaritybetween different classes on different levels.
partially ordered set
partition into antichains


allows assess taxonomies

tetaxa (impl. tusing f)
gives likelyhood for alternative taxonomies
